GEMSEC is a graph embedding algorithm which learns an embedding and clustering jointly. The procedure places nodes in an abstract feature space where the vertex features minimize the negative log likelihood of preserving sampled vertex neighborhoods while the nodes are clustered into a fixed number of groups in this space. GEMSEC is a general extension of earlier work in the domain as it is an augmentation of the core optimization problem of sequence based graph embedding procedures and it is agnostic of the neighborhood sampling strategy (first/second-order random walks).

**GEMSEC** is available in the **NetworkX** extension package [Karate Club](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/karateclub).
  
The second-order random walks sampling methods were taken from the reference implementation of [Node2Vec](https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec).

```
### Requirements

The codebase is implemented in Python 3.5.2 | Anaconda 4.2.0 (64-bit). Package versions used for development are just below.
```
networkx          2.4
tqdm              4.19.5

### Datasets
<p align="justify">
The code takes an input graph in a csv file. Every row indicates an edge between two nodes separated by a comma. The first row is a header. Nodes should be indexed starting with 0. Sample graphs for the `Facebook Politicians` and `Facebook Companies` datasets are included in the  `data/` directory.</p>

### Logging

The models are defined in a way that parameter settings and cluster quality is logged in every single epoch. Specifically we log the followings:

```
1. Hyperparameter settings.     We save each hyperparameter used in the experiment.
2. Cost per epoch.              Embedding, clustering and regularization cost are stored depending on the model type.
3. Cluster quality.             Measured by modularity. We calculate it both for the classical and neural clusterings per epoch.
4. Runtime.                     We measure the time needed for optimization and data generation per epoch -- measured by seconds.
```

### Options

Learning of the embedding is handled by the `src/embedding_clustering.py` script which provides the following command line arguments.
